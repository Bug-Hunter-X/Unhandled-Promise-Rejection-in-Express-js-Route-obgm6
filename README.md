# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled promise rejections in asynchronous route handlers.  Improper error handling can lead to silent failures, making debugging difficult. The `bug.js` file showcases this issue, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route that performs an asynchronous operation (`someAsyncOperation()`). If this operation fails, the error is not caught, resulting in an unhandled promise rejection.  This can lead to the server continuing to run, but without gracefully handling the error or providing feedback to the client.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct approach. It uses a `.catch()` block to handle potential errors from `someAsyncOperation()`.  A comprehensive error handling strategy should include logging the error for debugging purposes and sending an appropriate response to the client (e.g., a 500 Internal Server Error).

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run `node bug.js` (for the buggy version) or `node bugSolution.js` (for the corrected version).
4. Observe the console output and server behavior.
